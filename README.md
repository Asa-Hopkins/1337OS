# 1337OS
A bootloader program written in NASM Assembly. Not really an OS, but this system acts as a playground for me to code on bare metal.

Started in 2017, this has gone through multiple total rewrites as I've discovered better ways to do things, however I made certain to preserve the rhythmic beeping noises exactly as they were.

I revisit this project periodically to add a new module, and the hours deciphering my own code have taught me many valuable lessons in proper commenting and labeling.
